1. What are the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

   - DBMS, provides an organized way of managing, retrieving and storing from a collection of logically related information
   - RDBMS, provides same as DBMS, but provides with relational integrity

2. What are the different types of DBMS and explain the term database

   - We can say database is a big container where the data stored in logical manner.
   - DBMS, is a software application which interacts with database and allow to modify, retrieve, delete the data base as required.
   - Different types of DBMS are:
     1. Object-Oriented:
        a. The data is represented as object.
        b. This database uses Object-Oriented programming language.
     2. Relational:
        a. Stored in the form of tables.
        b. All the tables are related to one another.
     3. Hierarchical:
        a. The data stored in the form of tree structure.
        b. It has single parent and limited to certain function.
     4. Network:
        a. This is Similar to Hierarchical but has multiple parents and multiple joint records

3. What are the advantage of DBMS?

   - Data security:
     - It allows only user that are authorized.
   - Improved Data quality
   - Faster Data accessibility
   - Data backup:

     - It periodically auto backup the data

   - Simplicity
   - Reduced data redundancy

4. What is query optimization?

   - It is a way of finding the best methods for implementing the query.
   - It is basically used to the improve the speed of fetching the data from the database.
   - And also reduces the system resources required to run the query, which also results in enhancing the performance.

5. what is data partitioning? And what is the importance of partitioning

   - Dividing the data into small parts and manageable parts
   - It improves the maintenance, performance and management
   - There are two types of partitioning: 1. Vertical 2.horizontal partitioning

6. What are types of data replication?

   - Full table replication
   - Transactional replication:
     - Copied only initially and receive updates when the data is updated
   - snapshot replication
   - merge replication

7. What is normalization? And what are the different types of normalization.

   - We organize data in such a way, so that it reduces the data redundancy

8. Different types of keys?

   - Candidate key:
     - Uniquely identify a row.
   - ![Primary Key](~/Downloads/primarykey.png):

   - ![Super key](~/Pictures/240728_13h55m42s_screenshot.png)

   - ![Foriegn key](~/Pictures/240728_13h59m28s_screenshot.png)

   - ![Composite key](~/Pictures/240728_14h02m32s_screenshot.png)

   - ![Secondary key or Alternate key](~/Pictures/240728_14h01m37s_screenshot.png)
